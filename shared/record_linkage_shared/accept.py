''' Function to accept matches from candidate pairs
by blocking pass based on similarity scores.

This function is called by the main script, match.py.

The acceptance criteria for each pass is included in the
comments preceding each code section below.

    Evaluate pairs under a given blocking pass based on their similarity scores
    and flag whether they meet the following thresholds:
        - strict match
        - moderate match
        - relaxed match
        - unmatched but might be considered for clerical review
    See in-line comments for specific match criteria.

    Input:
        - df_match: output dataframe from match.py, incl. pair indices and scores
        - passnum: the pass number
        - config (dict)

    Returns the dataframe with four additional boolean columns:
